# Deck Creation Script Usage Guide

## Overview

The `create-deck.js` script allows you to interactively create One Piece TCG deck objects with full validation according to official game rules.

## Features

- **Interactive Deck Building**: Step-by-step process to create decks

## Prerequisites

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Run the script directly
node deck-management/create-deck.js

# Or if executable permissions are set
./deck-management/create-deck.js
```

### Interactive Process

1. **Enter Deck Name**: Provide a name for your deck
2. **Select Leader**: Search and select a leader card
3. **Build Main Deck**: Add cards to reach exactly 50 cards
4. **Validation**: Script validates the deck automatically
5. **Save**: Deck is saved as a JSON file

    "name": "Monkey D. Luffy",
    "cardType": "LEADER",

  "isValid": true,
  "validationErrors": []
}
```

## Tips

1. **Search Effectively**: Use partial names or card IDs to find cards quickly
2. **Plan Your Deck**: Think about your strategy before starting
3. **Check Colors**: Make sure your leader's colors support your strategy
4. **Balance Your Deck**: Consider cost distribution and card types
5. **Use Copy Limits**: Don't forget you can have up to 4 copies of each card

## Troubleshooting

### "Error loading card data"
- Make sure `db.json` exists in the project root
- Check that the file contains valid JSON with a `cards` array

### "No cards found matching your search"
- Try different search terms
- Use partial names (e.g., "luffy" instead of "Monkey D. Luffy")
- Use card IDs (e.g., "ST01-001")

### "Invalid selection"
- Make sure to enter a number corresponding to the card you want
- Numbers are shown next to each card in the search results

## Integration

The script exports functions that can be used in other parts of your application:

```javascript
const { createDeck, validateDeck, getDeckStats } = require('./deck-management/create-deck.js');

// Use the validation function
const validation = validateDeck(deckObject);
console.log('Is valid:', validation.isValid);

// Get deck statistics
const stats = getDeckStats(deckObject);
console.log('Total cards:', stats.totalCards);
```
